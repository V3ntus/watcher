## About

`watcher` is a web service that ingests your captured Kismetdb data locally and lets you query
the data.

## Features

- [ ] Merge multiple Kismetdb captures into one.
  - Take in account of unique device IDs (should merge data, keep old/new, etc.)
- [ ] Map out captured WiFi AP's and stations, and BLE devices (requires GPS).
- [ ] Allow querying for devices, including providing pre-made queries.
  - "What devices have I passed the most?"
  - "Where have I seen X device?"
  - "At what point did I see the most devices?"
  - Filter for ESSIDs, BSSIDs, OUIs, etc.
- [ ] (?) Load an LLM in-browser allowing users to query the data through AI.
